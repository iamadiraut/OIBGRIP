***This was great experience, working as a Web Developer and Web Designer. First of all thanks to [Oasis Infobytes](https://oasisinfobyte.com) for providing me such a great internship opportunity as a Web Development and Web Designer***

I choose to work on the level 2(2 tasks):

## <a href="https://huzefamehidpurwala.github.io/level2task1/"> Task-1/Calculator </a>

It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It will need a  display screen to display the user’s input and give the results. The grid system in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator. The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on. 

## <a href="https://huzefamehidpurwala.github.io/level2task2/"> Task-2/Tribute Page </a>

With a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, you can easily create a page for someone you admire. Write about what you adore in the person, add images, give an appealing layout, use paragraphs appropriately. You can also play around with different font styles and background colors.
